## Projects that about testing
### Project 1: To-Do List Website Testing with Cypress
- **Description**: This project involved testing a self-made to-do list website using Cypress. I created automated test cases to verify that all core functionalities such as adding, editing, deleting, and completing tasks worked as expected.
    - Tested user interactions including task creation, task status updates (complete/incomplete), and deletion.
    - Implemented both functional and end-to-end tests using Cypress to ensure all features performed correctly across different browsers.
    - Used Cypress Dashboard for test runs and detailed reporting of test results.(i use mochawesome and cypress-mochawesome-reporter to report result)
